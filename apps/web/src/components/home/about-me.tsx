        <ArticleHeaderTitle>Hi, Iâ€™m Paulina ðŸ‘‹</ArticleHeaderTitle>

        <ArticleText>
          Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building
          little projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I
          learn along the way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll find me reading,
          hiking through the mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing
          walls.
          <br />
          <br />I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself
          accountable, and hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to code.
          Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for stopping by!
